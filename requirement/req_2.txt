1.what is ecmascript?
1.ECMAScript, along with the Document Object Model,
works similarly to current implementations of JScript and JavaScript.
ECMAScript become a programming language that is supported by almost all modern web browsers.
ECMAScript is object-oriented and is considered a mainstream programming language

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
filter : 
This method executes a function for each item of an array,
then those items that pass the condition of the function are displayed in the output.
map : 
This method applies a series of operations on each member of the array and pours the output into a new array.
find : 
This method returns the first member for which our desired condition is satisfied. 
Using this method is good for when we have an array of several objects and each of these objects contains a specific field,
for example id.
findIndex: 
Using the findIndex() method, we can search the array items and display the index number of the first result obtained in the output.
some : 
If we want to check if at least one member of the array accept our desired condition, we use this method.
The output of this method is true if our condition is met for at least one member of the array. otherwise false
every :
This method is used if we want to check whether all the members of the array accept a condition.
The output of the method is Boolean and is true only if all members of the array satisfy the condition.
foreach : 
for-in : 
If we have an object, we can browse its keys (properties) with this type of for. How to write it is as follows
for-of :
This loop iterates over the values of the Iterable objects. Iterable is something that can be used in a loop. 
Like a regular array. Normal objects that are { } are not iterable by default; That means we cannot use them in rings.
But they can be made iterable with methods.
sort : 
The sort method sorts the members of an array. By default, this sort is in ascending order.
Before starting the sorting, the array members are temporarily converted to strings and then the sorting is done.

3.for-in versus for-of
3.usually we use for-in for objects but we use for-of for arrays

4.find versus filter
4.The filter() method returns an array that contains the element that meets the condition,
but the find() method itself returns the element that contains the specified condition. In the filter() method,
even though the searched element is at the beginning, the method is repeated over the entire array.

5.map versus foreach
5.The main difference between map and forEach is that the map method returns a new array by
applying a callback function to each element of the array,
while the forEach method does not return anything.

6.some versus every
6. in some method if any member accept condition some method return true ,
but in every method all members must accept condition to return true
